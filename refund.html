        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <h2>1. Terms</h2>

        <p>Usually, our Refund policy is applicable in rare situations. Any error or fault from our side may bring out
            refund issues, but only after reviewing the whole circumstances. Delay in Webinars, or missing the Live
            workshops by the attendee is not liable for Refund. Refund is only possible if we are unable to deliver the
            content you have paid for.</p>

        <p>For Classes being canceled for an indefinite time or permanently, students are eligible to get a full refund
            of their course fees.</p>

        <p>For any sudden changes in a decision from the customerâ€™s side, no refund shall be generated.</p>

        <h2>2. Processing</h2>

        <p>Process of your Refund Request can take 2 - 7 Days from our end and 7 - 14 working days from the Payment
            Provider's end. The refunded amount will be credited to the same payment method (Bank Account/ Credit card/
            Wallet).</p>

        <h2>3. Support</h2>
